# VKFW - a GLFW equivalent in the Vulkan interface style

This is a basic equivalent to GLFW, but in the Vulkan interface style - with create infos instead of hints, enums instead of `#define` values and combined state retrieval and change functions. Besides that, it is pretty much the same as GLFW 3.4 and currently implemented as a wrapper around most of its functionality.

The object model of VKFW is as follows: first you create a VkfwInstance, which is beasically the same as the GLFW session between initialization and termination, as an object handle. Then you can enumerate the monitors and joysticks in that Instance, and can create Cursors and Windows. The rest of the functions are state retrieval and change functions on those objects, and always have the object they operate on as their first parameter. There also is support for custom allocators, but currently only for one in the Instance, which has to match the other allocator parameter passed as a result of the decision of GLFW to only allow allocator changes between library initializations; that limitation is not part of the VKFW interface.
