# VKFW - a GLFW equivalent in the Vulkan interface style

This is a basic equivalent to GLFW, but in the Vulkan interface style - with create infos instead of hints, enums instead of `#define` values and combined state retrieval and change functions. Besides that, it is pretty much the same as GLFW 3.4 and currently a wrapper around most of its functionality.
